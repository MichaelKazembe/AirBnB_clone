The goal of the airbnb clone project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

First version is Console Only, manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention of how your objects are stored.
